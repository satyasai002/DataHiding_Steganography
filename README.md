# DataHiding_Steganography
This project is a python-based implementation for hiding data in images and sharing the image between multiple users. The project utilizes MySQL as the database and Streamlit for the user interface.
# Project Description
The main objective of this project is to hide confidential data in images and split the image between multiple users. To access the encoded content, all the users must upload their shares, and the decoded data will be displayed. This project consists of two parts: the admin server and the user server.

The admin server manages the creation of shares and data encoding, while the user server handles share uploading, decoding, and data retrieval. The user interface is developed using Streamlit, which provides a user-friendly interface for users to access the encoded data.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of hiding data in images and splitting the image between multiple users using Python and MySQL. The Streamlit interface provides a user-friendly interface for users to access the encoded data. This project can be extended to include additional features such as encryption and decryption of data.
